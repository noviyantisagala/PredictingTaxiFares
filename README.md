# PredictingTaxiFares

Project Description
In this project, I work with the data from a large number of taxi journeys in New York from 2013. 
Using regression trees and random forests to predict the value of fares and tips, based on location, date and time. While not required, it can help to have some extended experience with the packages dplyr, ggplot2 and randomForests.

The dataset used in this project is a sample from the complete 2013 NYC taxi data, which was originally obtained and published by Chris Whong.
